    <ol>
        <li>For words beginning with a vowel it will add "way" to the end. For Pig Latin, vowels are "a," "e," "i," "o," and "u." It wont treat "y" as a vowel. <em>Examples: "away" becomes "awayway" and "okay" becomes "okayway."</em></li>
        <br>
        <li>For words beginning with one or more consonants, it will move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end and add "ay". <em>Examples: "code" becomes "odecay" and "move" becomes "ovemay."</em></li>
        <br>
        <li>If the first consonants include "qu", it will move the "q" and the "u." Words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first count too! <em>Examples: "quick" becomes "ickquay" while "squeal" becomes "quealsay."</em></li>
